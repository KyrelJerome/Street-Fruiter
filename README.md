# Street-Fruiter
This Project is written in Java using Graphics2D as a rendering tool. The game allows for two players to play as animated pears, and fight on a platform. After being noticed that rendering in Graphics2D is inherently slow, I have moved to transferring the game concept to a smoother, custom OpenGL rendering engine dubbed Project Burst.
